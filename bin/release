# TODO:
#
# * Verify that a release with the current version number doesn't already exist.
#   * Could use the GitHub API for this.
#
# * Look for current build in the `target/` directory.
#
# * Maybe verify that the build is current, somehow.
#   * Maybe bin/build could tag the builds with a checksum of the current state
#     of the project, and bin/release could verify the checksum?
#
# * Push a new git version tag.
#
# * Create a new release via the GitHub API.
#
# * Generate a release description from the CHANGELOG.
#
# * Upload the builds to the release.
#
# * Post to Alda slack #general about the new release.
