# TODO:
#
# * Verify that a release with the current version number doesn't already exist.
#   * Could use the GitHub API for this.
#
# * Look for current build in the `target/` directory.
#   * Can tag the builds by git SHA. I think enforcing that every build
#     corresponds to a git SHA (even if it's on a local-only branch) is a good
#     thing.
#   * Maybe I can tag the builds by both git SHA and a checksum of the current
#     contents of the directory? That way, I could do local builds that I don't
#     intend to release, and when it comes time to release, this script could
#     enforce that the git state is clean and that there is a current build.
#
# * Push a new git version tag.
#
# * Create a new release via the GitHub API.
#
# * Generate a release description from the CHANGELOG.
#
# * Upload the builds to the release.
#
# * Post to Alda slack #general about the new release.
