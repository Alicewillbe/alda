*New to Alda? You may be interested in reading [this blog post][alda-blog-post] as an introduction.*

Inspired by other music/audio programming languages such as [PPMCK][ppmck],
[LilyPond][lilypond] and [ChucK][chuck], Alda aims to be a powerful and flexible
programming language for the musician who wants to easily compose and generate
music on the fly, using only a text editor.  Alda is designed in a way that
equally favors aesthetics, flexibility and ease of use, with (eventual) support
for the text-based creation of all manner of music: classical, popular,
  chiptune, electroacoustic, and more!

## Features

* Easy to understand, markup-like syntax
* Designed for musicians who don't know how to program, and programmers who
  don't know how to music
* A score is a text file that can be played using the `alda` command-line tool
* [Interactive REPL](doc/alda-repl.md) lets you enter Alda code and hear the
  results in real time
* Supports [writing music
  programmatically](doc/writing-music-programmatically.md) (for algorithmic
  composition, live coding, etc.)
* Create MIDI music using any of the instruments in the [General MIDI Sound
  Set][gm-sound-set]

[gm-sound-set]: http://www.midi.org/techspecs/gm1sound.php

### Planned

* [Define and use waveform synthesis instruments](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda/issues/100)
* [Import MIDI files](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/25)
* [Export to MusicXML](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/issues/3) for inter-operability with other music software
* [A more robust REPL](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-client-java/issues/2), tailor-made for editing scores interactively

## Syntax example

    piano: o3
    g8 a b > c d e f+ g | a b > c d e f+ g4
    g8 f+ e d c < b a g | f+ e d c < b a g4
    << g1/>g/>g/b/>d/g

For more examples, see these [example scores](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda-core/tree/master/examples).

## Installation

> **TODO**: Develop an installation process for Alda 2.0.

### MIDI soundfonts

Default JVM soundfonts usually are of low quality. We recommend installing a good freeware soundfont like FluidR3 to make your MIDI instruments sound a lot nicer.

#### Mac OS X / Linux

For your convenience, there is a script in this repo that will install the FluidR3 soundfont for Mac and Linux users.

To install FluidR3 on your Mac or Linux system, clone this repo and run:

    scripts/install-fluidr3

This will download FluidR3 and replace `~/.gervill/soundbank-emg.sf2` (your JVM's default soundfont) with it.

#### Windows

<img src="doc/windows_jre_soundfont.png" alt="Replacing the JVM soundfont on Windows">

To replace the default soundfont on a Windows OS:

1. Locate your Java Runtime (JRE) folder and navigate into the `lib` folder. 
   * If you have JDK 8 or earlier installed, locate your JDK folder instead and navigate into the `jre\lib` folder. 
2. Make a new folder named `audio`.
3. Copy any `.sf2` file into this folder.

A variety of popular freeware soundfonts, including FluidR3, are available for download [here](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts#list).

### Editor Plugins

For the best experience when editing Alda score files, install the Alda file-type plugin for your editor of choice.

## Demo

> **TODO**: Update this for Alda 2.0.

First start the Alda server (this may take a minute):

    alda up

To play a file containing Alda code:

    alda play --file examples/bach_cello_suite_no_1.alda

To play arbitrary code at the command line:

    alda play --code "piano: c6 d12 e6 g12~4"

To start an [Alda REPL](doc/alda-repl.md):

    alda repl
