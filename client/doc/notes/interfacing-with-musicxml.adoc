= Interfacing with MusicXML

== Background

* MusicXML is the standard open format for exchanging digital sheet music, and
is supported by popular programs like Finale, Sibelius, and MuseScore.

* MusicXML is defined both by Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and an XML Schema
Definition (XSD).

* One goal of Alda is to be interoperable with popular formats like MusicXML, so
we require a way for our Go client to interface with (parse and write) MusicXML.

== Exploration: attempting to model MusicXML in Go

* The ideal scenario, when interfacing with a MusicXML file, is to be able to
unmarshal the file into a group of Go structs.

* First, I tried looking at various existing libraries to parse XSD definitions
and auto-generate the structs for us. Most of them barely worked, but two
performed quite well, so I forked them to continue development.

** https://github.com/Scowluga/xgen[xgen] was my first attempt. Unfortunately,
it doesn't handle nesting of `xs:group` and `xs:attributeGroup` tags.

** https://github.com/Scowluga/go-xml[go-xml] was my next attempt. The code that
this library generates is quite impressive, and I made various enhancements.

=== Running into problems
* Unfortunately, while working on the go-xml library, I kept running into issues
that didn't immediately have clear solutions. As an example, consider how to
model a MusicXML partwise measure that contains the `music-data` group.

** Upon inspection (see the
https://github.com/w3c/musicxml/blob/v3.1/schema/musicxml.xsd[MusicXML XSD]),
the `music-data` group consists of an unbounded sequence of elements, for which
each element can be 1 of 13 possible types including `note`, `backup`, and more.

** By default, this is what the converter outputs:

    type Measure struct {
        Note           *Note        `xml:"note"`
        Backup         *Backup      `xml:"backup"`
        Forward        *Forward     `xml:"forward"`
        Direction      *Direction   `xml:"direction"`
        Attributes     *Attributes  `xml:"attributes"`
        ...

** The default generated `Measure` struct can only contain one of each element
type, and the elements themselves are not ordered. This obviously doesn't work.

** A fix for both of the above problems is to instead have `Measure` contain an
attribute of type `[]interface{}`, where each list element itself can then be
one of the 13 possible types.


    type Measure struct {
        MusicData []interface{}
        ...

** This works in theory, and in fact it gets quite far. I was able to write a
marshal method that loops through `MusicData` and encodes each element.

** Unfortunately, when you get to the unmarshal method, we see a problem: to
decode, you need the type of the object you are decoding. Since each element can
be 1 of 13 types, however, we don't have the type when we are decoding. To my
knowledge, there is no easy way to obtain this information.



=== Why a model will never work

* Upon inspection of the Go unmarshal source code, I came across the following
comment.

    // Mapping between XML elements and data structures is inherently flawed

* XML and Go structs are fundamentally different ways
to represent data, and trying to obtain a one-to-one mapping is likely not worth
the effort.

* Looking at the real world supports this claim. One popular site that supports
MusicXML is https://musescore.org/en[MuseScore]. Diving into their MusicXML
importer, they interface directly with an XML parser, and never actually model
the file completely.

* It appears that from this exploration, the correct way to interface with
MusicXML is directly in an Alda importer or exporter.
